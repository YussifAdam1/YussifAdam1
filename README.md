# About Me
Hello! I'm Yussif Adam, a 27-year-old student at the Bit Academy in Amsterdam, specializing in software development. My primary focus lies in becoming a front-end developer, and I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Bootstrap, and I'm continuously learning more. Additionally, I have experience in data analysis and visualization, working with tools like Power BI, PostgreSQL, Excel, Azure, Jupyter Notebook and in backend development with PHP.

While I'm currently learning both front-end and back-end development as part of my course, my ultimate goal is to become a proficient front-end developer. I'm enthusiastic about learning and always eager to participate in new challenges.
